# Kinect Controller for Dark Souls

This program allows for one to attempt to play Dark Souls (on PC) using only a Kinect as a controller.
It was designed for the purpose of a challenge run, but I never managed to complete it because the controls were
too unreliable. Still, it is a fun project to learn more about the Kinect and gesture recognition. Perhaps someone
can finish this ultimate challenge one day.

# Requirements

* Requires XInputEmu (https://github.com/bearzly/XInputEmu) to communicate XInput controls to the game
* Only tested with an original Xbox 360 Kinect (not Kinect for Windows)
* Built with Kinect SDK version 1.8. Unknown if this will continue to work/work better with a newer Kinect/SDK 2.0.

# Controls

* Either hand can making a grabbing gesture to manipulate a virtual joystick for movement/camera controller
* Buttons are mapped to swipe gestures with either hand
* Lock-on and block are controlled by pushing gestures with the right and left hand respectively
* D-pad is used by pressing virtual buttons on either side below the waste
* Some secret gestures \[T]/ https://gfycat.com/CloudyInferiorAmazonparrot
